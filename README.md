# AA-Artificial-Lipid-Bilayer-Tutorial

This tutorial guides new users through setting up a simulation system that includes a symmetric, multi-component lipid bilayer membrane in a box of water. This workflow was employed in the study: [Enthalpic and Entropic Contributions to Interleaflet Coupling Drive Domain Registration and Anti-registration in Biological Membrane](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.462263v1.abstract).

## Requirements

The following software packages are recommended for this tutorial:
- **GROMACS**
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **MDAnalysis**

Please refer to `manual.pdf` for detailed setup instructions and guidance.
