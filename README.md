# MEMBRANE BIOPHYSICS TUTORIAL
## AA-Artificial-Lipid-Bilayer-Tutorial

This tutorial will guide a new user through the process of setting up a simulation system
containing a symmetric multi-component lipid bilayer membrane in a box of water. This workflow has 
been employed in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.462263v1.abstract">Enthalpic and Entropic Contributions to Interleaflet Coupling Drive Domain Registration and Anti-registration in Biological Membrane</a>

This tutorial assumes you are using a GROMACS version in the 2018.x series.
